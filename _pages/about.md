I am a PhD student in Computer Vision at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), supervised by [Prof. Ioannis Patras](https://sites.google.com/view/ioannispatras/home). I started my program in 2020. I received my BSc in Communication Engineering in 2017, and my MSc in Information and Communication Engineering in 2019, both at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT).

Previously I was a software engineer at Intel from 2019 to 2020. I interned at Tencent in [Media Lab](https://avlab.qq.com/) headed by [Dr. Shan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bdBZ43wAAAAJ&hl=en) in summer 2018.

My research interests include machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on self-supervised pre-training.
